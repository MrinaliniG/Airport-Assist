Airport Assistant for Elders  

 - Problem Statement
 
Air travel is an exciting experience for some. For others, it is a way of life. However, for seniors, air travel can pose as an extremely daunting challenge. Though airlines do provide special care and facilities for elders, they are typically for the benefit of those who have health difficulties. But what about seniors who do not have any pressing health issues, but simply find the various airport procedures too confusing to follow? Many seniors completely avoid traveling in flights due to this. In todayâ€™s world, where families are geographically separated, something as simple as fear of air travel should not prevent them from visiting their loved ones. 

 - Proposed Solution
 
Imagine a person guiding seniors through the airport to boarding. From reminding what documents to carry, providing tips regarding the security check protocols, real time gate information for their flights and any change in gate and flight times. We propose to build a voice assistant to guide seniors every step of the way for air travel.
