## Project Ideas:

### 1. Prevention of Land frauds

Cases of double ownership of land are common in many countries where gangs collude with officials to create parallel titles for pieces of land they want to acquire illegally. Governments and businesses around the world are exploring ways to store data, such as contracts and assets which cannot be modified by anyone. Storing these in blockchains - which are ledgers of digital transactions – would make these digital registries immutable and cross-checked by a network of computer users.

Blockchain would help by making all land records publicly available online and eliminate multiple titles for the same piece of land. Entries to these blockchains identifying the selling of a property would only be made by government officials, but the current ownership of land would be publicly available to everyone.

### 2. Airport Assistant for Elders

 - Problem Statement
 
Air travel is an exciting experience for some. For others, it is a way of life. However, for seniors, air travel can pose as an extremely daunting challenge. Though airlines do provide special care and facilities for elders, they are typically for the benefit of those who have health difficulties. But what about seniors who do not have any pressing health issues, but simply find the various airport procedures too confusing to follow? Many seniors completely avoid traveling in flights due to this. In today’s world, where families are geographically separated, something as simple as fear of air travel should not prevent them from visiting their loved ones. 

 - Proposed Solution
 
Imagine a person guiding seniors through the airport to boarding. From reminding what documents to carry, providing tips regarding the security check protocols, real time gate information for their flights and any change in gate and flight times. We propose to build a voice assistant to guide seniors every step of the way for air travel.  

### 3. Weather control station

 - Problem Statement
 
There have been instances where temperature of a room inadvertently increased or decreased, this can cause the body temperatures of individuals present in the room to change drastically, affecting their central nervous system and circulatory system.

 - Proposed Solution
 
An IoT based weather control station will help us in not only measuring the room temperature, but it’ll also measure altitude and pressure in the room. We can then configure alerts sent over web and also in the form of sound alarms with LED lights when temperature crosses a certain threshold.
We can connect this raspberry pi device to cloud account to store weather data and then derive useful analytics from it.  

### 4. Crime information and alert system

Our solution will aim to assist the users by informing them about the dangerous, crime-hot places in the city so that they can use alternate routes and avoid these places while travelling in the city. The system will use the crime and demographic data as the input dataset.

The solution will potentially use Big Data analysis through Spark/HDFS and Node JS based web-client to process the incoming data-set, publish the analysis and alert the registered users as new crimes happen.
